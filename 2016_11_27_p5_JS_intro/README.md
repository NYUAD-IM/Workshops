Javascript + p5 Workshop
========================

This workshop will introduce the p5 javascript library, which follows in the footsteps of Processing - to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. We will explore how to set up a web page with p5, draw shapes, create animations, and more. All skill levels and backgrounds are welcome. Please bring a laptop.
