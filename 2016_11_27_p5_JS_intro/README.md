Javascript + p5 Workshop
========================

This workshop will introduce the [p5](http://p5js.org/) javascript library, which follows in the footsteps of [Processing](https://processing.org/) - to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners. We will explore how to set up a web page with p5, draw shapes, create animations, and more. All skill levels and backgrounds are welcome. Please bring a laptop.


### BEFORE WE START
*	You are going to need a 'code-friendly' text editor. We will use this text editor to create and write the files we need for our application. If you don't have a Text Editor, there are many to choose from. Here are some free ones that will work for this exercise:
	* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3)
	* [Text Wrangler](http://download.cnet.com/TextWrangler/3000-2351_4-10220012.html) (Mac Only)
	* [TextMate](http://macromates.com/) (Mac Only)
	* [Notepad++](http://notepad-plus-plus.org/download/v6.7.4.html)
*	**[DOWNLOAD](http://p5js.org/download/)** the p5.js "Complete Library"
