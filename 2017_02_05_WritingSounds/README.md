## WRITING SOUNDS

### Setup

Since we are going to be loading files in our JS script, and some browsers consider that a security concern, we will need to run **a local server** in order for us not to run into any errors.
This is an easy process, which can be done in the command line:

1. Open the terminal (OSX) or the Console (Windows).
2. Type in `which python`.
3. If something similar to `/usr/bin/python` shows up, you're fine! (skip to step 5)
4. If nothing shows up, please [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Python.
5. [Navigate](https://computers.tutsplus.com/tutorials/navigating-the-terminal-a-gentle-introduction--mac-3855) to your directory in the Terminal.
6. In the Terminal, type in `python -m SimpleHTTPServer`. You should get a message similar to `Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 ...`
7. Open your browser, and type `localhost:8000` in your URL bar. It should automatically serve any `index.html` file in your present working directory.
