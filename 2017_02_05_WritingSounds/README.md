## WRITING SOUNDS

### Setup

Since we are going to be loading files in our JS script, and some browsers consider that a security concern, we will need to run **a local server** in order for us not to run into any errors.
This is an easy process, which can be done in the command line:
1. Open the terminal (OSX) or the Console (Windows).
2. Type in `which python`.
3. If something similar to `/usr/bin/python` shows up, you're fine!
4. If nothing shows up, please [download](https://www.python.org/downloads/) Python.
use `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` for serving files, it is [built-in](https://milocast.com/pyhttp.html)
